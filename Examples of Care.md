# Examples of Care


## Individual


## Tactical
From [The Other Side of the Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Mountain-Mujahideen-Soviet-Afghan/dp/B000KD7794).
* During Operation Arrow, (1988) General Wardak demonstrated care for his men by carefully organizing rotation of forces so fighters could rest and establishing supply lines to ensure his men had food and ammunition. 
* In the Battle for Chaharqulba Village (1987), Commander Akhtarjhan and his men fought hard to defend each other and showed concern for their wounded. As they ran out of ammunition, he helped organize an orderly withdrawal to save his men rather than fighting to the last man.
* A squad commander who fought for the Mujahideen during the war smuggled his men's families to safety in Pakistan.

## Operational
David Hackworth (in both _About Face_ and _Steel my Soldier's Hearts_) points out that caring for your people is amongst a leader's fundamental skills. He says,"I tried to make sure the rifle soldiers dried out for a few hours every day by lying up in the bush with their boots off and bringing them back to the firebase about every four days for a four-day stint of security. The policy kept them combat ready and, equally important, it showed them that their commander cared about them."  

## Strategic
In Emperor Leo VI's _Tactica_, it is said that a General should "share on all occasions the work and fatigue of the men" and that he should be loved by his men, because men will die for love of their commander.
