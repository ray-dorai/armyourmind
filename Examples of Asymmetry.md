# Examples of Asymmetry


## Individual
[In this video](https://youtu.be/xHVBi2VCcQI?t=845), Sylvie Von Douglas-Ittu, Muay Thai fighter, points out that she was approaching her opponent's strength with her strength instead of using Asymmetry. Next, she takes her opponent to an environment (the clinch) which is her strength and less of a strength for her opponent.

## Tactical

[The Other Side of the Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Mountain-Mujahideen-Soviet-Afghan/dp/B000KD7794) has several examples.
* Mamur Hotel (1980-1981): Small Mujahideen force of around 50 fighters repeatedly ambushed much larger Soviet convoys at same location. Used elevated positions, coordinated fires, and dispersed groups to control 2km stretch of highway, destroying multiple vehicles before withdrawing.
* Abdullah-e Burj (1983): Around 350 Mujahideen trapped Soviet regiment straddling river at bridge crossing. Used coordinated fires from prepared positions on both sides of river, inflicting heavy casualties. Artillery and air support ineffective due to close combat.
* A 13-man team kidnapped a Soviet adviser from his home in Kabul.
* Chaharqulba (1986): About 500 Mujahideen defenders used prepared bunkers, trenches, and mobile reserve forces to resist major Soviet offensive for 34 days. Turned urban terrain into fortress, counterattacking when possible, rotating fighters to maintain effectiveness.
