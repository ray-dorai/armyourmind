# Arm Your Mind

*Arm Your Mind* is a project to practice principles of conflict that transfer throughout individual, tactical, and strategic contexts. A familiarity with conflict trains comfort with uncertainty. Comfort with uncertainty bestows a sense of safety. People that feel safe make strong communities, and we're going to need strong communities to go wherever we're going.

What we can do to help make the world stronger **RIGHT NOW**:
* Help fill out examples for our list of principles from your own experience of history and life
* Document how these principles play out in any combat sport you may be learning
* Get your friends together for force-on-force exercises and show the world how you're learning to handle conflict

This collection was made possible with the support of [The McLegibilist](https://crispy.substack.com/), [Steepled Hat Studios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUOKkH_jmQZXrbjNllcvfHQ), and Tina Kovacova.
