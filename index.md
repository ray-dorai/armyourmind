# Arm Your Mind

*Arm Your Mind* is a project to notice forms of conflict that transfer throughout individual, tactical, and strategic contexts. A familiarity with conflict trains comfort with uncertainty. Comfort with uncertainty bestows a sense of safety. People that feel safe make strong communities, and we're going to need strong communities to go wherever we're going.

What we can do to help make the world stronger **RIGHT NOW**:
* Help fill out examples for our list of forms from your own experience of history and life
* Document how these forms play out in any combat sport you may be learning
* Get your friends together for force-on-force exercises and show the world how you're learning to handle conflict

This was made possible with the support of [The McLegibilist](https://crispy.substack.com/), [Carthage Must Be Destroyed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUOKkH_jmQZXrbjNllcvfHQ), [Colton Dillion](http://www.coltondillion.com/), and Tina Kovacova.
