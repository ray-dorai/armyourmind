# Examples of Terrain


## Individual
In [The Secret History of the Mongols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_History_of_the_Mongols), Temujin uses the thickly forested mountain slopes and swamps around Mt. [Burkhan Khaldun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhan_Khaldun) to elude the Merkit.

## Tactical
In May 1981 in Logar Province, Afghanistan, Haji Sayed Mohammad Hanif and ten other Mujahideen setup an ambush at [Tangi Waghjan Gorge](https://goo.gl/maps/xfM4J8ZBgCTjdqzg6). "There, the river continues to run parallel to the road and restricts maneuver while providing better firing positions for the ambush force." Despite poor markmanship and planning, the Mujahideen used the constraints of the road to their advantage. They destroyed a tank, which stopped the rest of the column. Once stopped, the column (which included 15 supply trucks) was captured by the Mujahideen.
