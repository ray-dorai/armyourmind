## How to edit and add notes

Click on the "edit" icon on the published site to edit any note (see [Editing files in your repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository) and [Creating new files](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files)).

As a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), Neuron benefits from linking notes. To understand how linking works, read [the neuron guide on Linking][linking].

For other ways to edit your notes (editors, web interface), see the [neuron guide][create].
