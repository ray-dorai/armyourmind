# Examples of Fix and Flank


## Individual
The boxer's [One-Two punch](https://youtu.be/KN9NGbIK2q8?t=13) is usually an attempt to fix an opponent with a Jab followed by a Cross from another angle- the Flank.

## Tactical
[US Army battle drill 2a](https://youtu.be/MtOL4EBqS7s?t=100) involves a standard response to direct small arms fire. When a squad takes fire, the fire team taking fire returns fire and aims to suppress the enemy. A successful suppression fixes the enemy enough for the second fire team to flank and fire at the enemy.
