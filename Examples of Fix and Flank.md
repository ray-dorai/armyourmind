# Examples of Fix and Flank


## Individual
The boxer's [One-Two punch](https://youtu.be/KN9NGbIK2q8?t=13) is usually an attempt to fix an opponent with a Jab followed by a Cross from another angle- the Flank.

## Tactical
[US Army battle drill 2a](https://youtu.be/MtOL4EBqS7s?t=100) involves a standard response to direct small arms fire. When a squad takes fire, the fire team taking fire returns fire and aims to suppress the enemy. A successful suppression fixes the enemy enough for the second fire team to flank and fire at the enemy.

[The Other Side of the Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Mountain-Mujahideen-Soviet-Afghan/dp/B000KD7794) has several examples.
* Battle for Panjwayee (1982) - The Mujahideen used a small group to penetrate and fix DRA forces while larger forces poured into the city from different directions.
* Chaghni Base Camp (1986) - The Soviets fixed the base defenders with frontal pressure while landing air assault forces on multiple LZs to attack from different directions.
* Krer One (1986) - The Soviets used a deception to fix Mujahideen attention on their frontal movement from Sarkani while secretly moving another column (possibly Spetsnaz) through Pashad to flank and attack from the rear, successfully overrunning the Mujahideen bases.
* Operation Magistral (1987) - The Soviets fixed Mujahideen attention on their movement toward Satakandow pass while moving forces through the Saroti pass, allowing them to seize key high ground between both axes.
