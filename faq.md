# FAQ

Who runs this site?
:  [Ray Doraisamy](https://ray-dorai.github.io/), under the purview of [Foretrek](https://www.foretrek.com) and [Agitproper](https://www.agitproper.org), Foretrek's propaganda arm.

How may I get edit access to this repository?
: E-mail agency[at]foretrek[dot]com.

Where are these principles from?
: These are distilled by reading countless papers, books, interviews on war, survival, and combat sports. They are tested further through combat sports, since that's what everyone has access to. If you'd like to add a principle, get consensus with three other editors and simply add it. Keep the language in the description so simple a five year old could understand it.
