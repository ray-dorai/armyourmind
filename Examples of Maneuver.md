# Examples of Maneuver


## Individual
Coaches in sports like grappling or MMA may shout things like "move, move, move" during training, and what they're usually trying to get the individual to do is more than simply moving their body quickly- it is a reminder to keep a moving mind, so that fixation on a goal is mitigated. Mental movement of this sort makes it harder for an opponent to focus on defending any particular technique, because you've moved on to the next avenue of approach the moment they've settled on an answer to your last direction of attack.

## Tactical
From [The Other Side of the Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Mountain-Mujahideen-Soviet-Afghan/dp/B000KD7794).
* Battle of Panjwayee (1982), Mulla Malang led 25 men in capturing Panjwayee by infiltrating through the town. The key innovation was knocking holes in walls to advance between buildings undetected. They surprised defenders who assumed the town was already captured, leading to a DRA retreat
* In Operation Magistral (1987), Soviets coordinated air assault seizure of high ground with ground advance through passes. Used overwhelming firepower before maneuver. Mujahideen withdrew to mountains initially but later returned to attack Soviet supply lines. Soviets achieved tactical success.
* Kandahar Urban Operations (1983-1987) Mujahideen used network of fortified positions in Malajat suburb to maneuver against Soviet/DRA forces. Multiple covered routes allowed reinforcement and withdrawal. Soviets never fully controlled area despite repeated large-scale operations with armor and air support.
